Wow. I really dislike code editors. Atom, VS Code, Brackets etc. I can't avoid getting overwhelmed by the amount of buttons and options and special tricks they have. It's probably a personal trace of mine, since everyone I know uses one of them. Also, at least to me, there has always been a lag/bug persistent issue with those guys. Atom just can't be. Brackets has for years had a strange window resize bug that simply drives me nuts, besides its magnificent add-ons searcher. VS Code seems to be the only reamining hero (note that I'm including only open source editors). I'm not a fan of its design, but it at least does its job without lagging.

I just wanted to make myself clear here: I don't hate specific things about this or that editor, but the simple fact of they being built in that away. All I want is a place to write my code and save it. For many times I have tried to simply copy content or break lines and ended up with two cursors blinking (???) or seeing the replacement of things that weren't supposed to be replaced (please?).

It's too much to be loaded for such a basic task. I feel like they're becoming a species of ~~MS Word~~ LibreOffice Writer, but for code. With bugs, many of them.

## Merch time
Not really, I just wanted to let you know about the new experiment I'm about to start. I'm gonna use [**Vim**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_&#40;text_editor&#41; "Vim on  Wikipedia") for one month. It's been installed on my PC for months but I never did anything on it besides installing NERDTree, I guess.
